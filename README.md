# ember-cli-deploy-compress

> An ember-cli-deploy plugin to compress files in-place choosing between gzip or brotli compression automatically based on your supported browsers.

This plugin is more or less the fusion of [ember-cli-deploy-gzip](https://github.com/ember-cli-deploy/ember-cli-deploy-gzip) and [ember-cli-deploy-brotli](https://github.com/mfeckie/ember-cli-deploy-brotli) that smartly uses your matrix of supported browsers (from `config/targets.js`) and the information
from [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=brotli) to decide the best compression automatically.

When brotli is supported you typically get around 17% reduction on file size of the average javascript files.  This compression is even larger with html and css files.

## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of ember-cli-deploy's pipeline hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-deploy-compress
```

## ember-cli-deploy Hooks Implemented

For detailed information on what plugin hooks are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

- `configure`
- `willUpload`

## Configuration Options

For detailed information on how configuration of plugins works, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

### filePattern

Files matching this pattern will be compressed.
Note: image files such as `.png`, `.jpg` and `.gif` are already compressed and therefore should not be included.

*Default:* `'\*\*/\*.{js,css,json,ico,map,xml,txt,svg,eot,ttf,woff,woff2}'`

### ignorePattern

Files matching this pattern will *not* be compressed even if they match `filePattern`.

*Default:* null

### distDir

The root directory where the files match `filePattern` will be searched.

By default, this option will use the `distDir` property of the deployment context, provided by [ember-cli-deploy-build][2].

*Default:* `context.distDir`

### distFiles

The list of built project files.

This option should be relative to `distDir` and should include the files that match `filePattern`. By default, this option will use the `distFiles` property of the deployment context, provided by [ember-cli-deploy-build][2].

*Default:* `context.distDir`

### zopfli

If brotli is not available for your browsers, use node-zopfli for gzip compression. It is better than regular gzip compression and a good substitute when brotli is not available.

If set to `true`, you will need to `npm install node-zopfli --save-dev` in your app.

*Default:* `false`

### keep

Keep original file and write compressed data to `originalFile.gz` (or `originalFile.br`, or both).

*Default:* `false`

### compression

It determines the compression algorithm used.

*Default:* `["best"]`

When the value is `["best"]`, it will automatically decide whether it can use brotli or if it has to stick
with gzip automatically.
If the users want to force one algorithm, they can force it by passing `compression: ["brotli"]`.
Also, users can force the addon to use both algorithms simultaneously with `compression: ["gzip", "brotli"]`. When both algorithms are used, the user has to also enable the `keep` option.


## Prequisites

The following properties are expected to be present on the deployment `context` object:

- `distDir`      (provided by [ember-cli-deploy-build][2])
- `distFiles`    (provided by [ember-cli-deploy-build][2])

## Plugins known to work well with this one

[ember-cli-deploy-build][2]
[ember-cli-deploy-s3][3] (Starting in version 1.2.0)

## Running Tests

* `yarn test`

## Why `ember build` and `ember test` don't work

Since this is a node-only ember-cli addon, this package does not include many files and dependencies which are part of ember-cli's typical `ember build` and `ember test` processes.
